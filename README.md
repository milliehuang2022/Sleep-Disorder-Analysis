# Sleep-Disorder-Analysis
In this project, I investigated sleep quality metrics associated with sleep disorders, using Python for EDA and Tableau for a dashboard. I also implemented a machine learning pipeline with Scikit-Learn to streamline standard scaling and logistic regression. Later, I employed cross-validation strategies to fine-tune predictive performance with various models including random forest and SVC.

## Tableau Dashboard

To summarize my findings in a cohesive visualization, I created a Tableau dashboard with easily accessible results, in which different sleep disorders can be highlighted for clarity.
